License Agreement as the "Welcome Interruption SDK" and specifically 
including, packaged APIs, and Welcome Interruption SDK library files, if and 
when they are made available) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the

between you and 3ES in relation to your use of the Welcome Interruption 
SDK. 

b.	"3ES" means 3 Electric Sheep Pty Ltd, an Australian corporation. 


2.	Accepting the License Agreement

License Agreement. You may not use the Welcome Interruption SDK if you 
do not accept the License Agreement. 

b.	By clicking to accept and/or using the Welcome Interruption SDK, you hereby 
agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 

c.	You may not use the Welcome Interruption SDK and may not accept the 
License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the Welcome 
Interruption SDK under the laws of Australia or other countries including the 
country in which you are resident or from which you use the Welcome 
Interruption SDK. 

d.	If you will use the Welcome Interruption SDK internally within your company 
or organization you agree to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of 
your employer or other entity, and you represent and warrant that you have 
full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License 
Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the 
License Agreement or use the Welcome Interruption SDK on behalf of your 
employer or other entity. 


3.	Welcome Interruption SDK License from 3ES

a.	Subject to the terms of this License Agreement, 3ES grants you a limited, 
worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-
sublicensable license to use the Welcome Interruption SDK solely to develop 
applications for compatible implementations of The Welcome Interruption 
Server. 

b.	You may not use this Welcome Interruption SDK to develop applications for 
other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of The Welcome 
Interruption Server) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free to 
develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible 
implementations of The Welcome Interruption Server, provided that this 
Welcome Interruption SDK is not used for that purpose. 

c.	You agree that 3ES or third parties owns all legal right, title and interest in 
and to the Welcome Interruption SDK, including any Intellectual Property 
Rights that subsist in the Welcome Interruption SDK. "Intellectual Property 
Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret 
law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. 3ES reserves all 
rights not expressly granted to you. 

d.	You may not use the Welcome Interruption SDK for any purpose not 
expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to the extent required 
by applicable third-party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup 
purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, 
disassemble, or create derivative works of the Welcome Interruption SDK or 
any part of the Welcome Interruption SDK. 

e.	Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the Welcome Interruption 
SDK licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by 
the terms of that open source software license and not the License 
Agreement. You agree to remain a licensee in good standing in regard to 
such open source software licenses under all the rights granted and to refrain 
from any actions that may terminate, suspend, or breach such rights. 

f.	You agree that the form and nature of the Welcome Interruption SDK that 
3ES provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions 
of the Welcome Interruption SDK may be incompatible with applications 
developed on previous versions of the Welcome Interruption SDK. You agree 
that 3ES may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Welcome 
Interruption SDK (or any features within the Welcome Interruption SDK) to 
you or to users generally at 3ES's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 

g.	Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of 3ES's trade 
names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive 
brand features. 

h.	You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights 
notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or 
contained within the Welcome Interruption SDK. 


4.	Use of the Welcome Interruption SDK by You

a.	3ES agrees that nothing in the License Agreement gives 3ES any right, title 
or interest from you (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to 
any software applications that you develop using the Welcome Interruption 
SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those 
applications. 

b.	You agree to use the Welcome Interruption SDK and write applications only 
for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement, and (b) any 
applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the 
relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or 
software to and from Australia or other relevant countries). 

c.	You agree that if you use the Welcome Interruption SDK to develop 
applications, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of users. If users 
provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or 
personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will 
be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate 
privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores 
personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If 
users provide you with 3ES Account information, your application may only 
use that information to access the user's 3ES Account when, and for the 
limited purposes for which, each user has given you permission to do so. 

d.	You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Welcome 
Interruption SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, 
that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized 
manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of 3ES or any 
third party. 

e.	You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that 3ES has no 
responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources 
that you create, transmit or display through The Welcome Interruption Server 
and/or applications for The Welcome Interruption Server, and for the 
consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which 3ES may 
suffer) by doing so. 

f.	You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that 3ES has no 
responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations 
under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of 
Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences 
(including any loss or damage which 3ES or any third party may suffer) of any 
such breach. 

g.	You understand and agree that this License Agreement only provides rights 
to use the Welcome Interruption SDK for development purposes and that you 
will enter into a commercial agreement ("Distribution Agreement") with 3ES to 
obtain the right to sell, exploit or otherwise distribute any application that has 
integrated the Welcome Interruption SDK. The Distribution Agreement will 
control in the event of a conflict with this License Agreement. 


5.	Privacy and Information

a.	In order to continually innovate and improve the Welcome Interruption SDK, 
3ES may collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not 
limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number of the 
software, crash reports, and information on which tools and/or services in the 
Welcome Interruption SDK are being used and how they are being used. 
Before any of this information is collected, you will be asked for consent. If 
you withhold consent, the information will not be collected. 

b.	The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the Welcome 
Interruption SDK and is maintained in accordance with 3ES's Privacy Policy. 


6.	Third Party Applications

a.	If you use the Welcome Interruption SDK to run applications developed by a 
third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, 
you agree that 3ES is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or 
resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may 
access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the 
person from which they originated and that 3ES is not liable for any loss or 
damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of 
those third party applications, data, content, or resources. 

b.	You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you 
through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual 
property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or 
companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, 
distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or 
resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given 
permission to do so by the relevant owners. 

c.	You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, 
or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant 
third party. 


7.	Using 3ES APIs

a.	If you use any API to retrieve data from 3ES, you acknowledge that the data 
may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by 3ES or 
those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their 
behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of 
Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create 
derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed 
by the relevant Terms of Service. 

b.	If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from 3ES, you acknowledge and 
agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only 
when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you 
permission to do so. 


8.	Terminating the License Agreement

a.	The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or 
3ES as set out below. 

b.	If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing 
your use of the Welcome Interruption SDK. 

c.	3ES may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if: (A) you 
have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B) 3ES is 
required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom 3ES offered certain 
parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with 3ES or 
ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) 3ES decides to no 
longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the country in 
which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of 
the SDK or certain SDK services to you by 3ES is, in 3ES's sole discretion, no 
longer commercially viable. 

d.	When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, 
obligations and liabilities that you and 3ES have benefited from, been subject 
to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been 
in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected 
by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 13(f) shall continue to 
apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

13.	General Legal Terms

a.	The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you

any services which 3ES may provide to you under a separate written 
agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and 
3ES in relation to the Welcome Interruption SDK. 

b.	You agree that if 3ES does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy 
which is contained in the License Agreement (or which 3ES has the benefit of

rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to 3ES. 

c.	If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that 
any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be 
removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License

to be valid and enforceable.

INTERRUPTION SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON 
DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 

e.	The License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by you without 
the prior written approval of 3ES, and any attempted assignment without such 
approval will be void. You shall not delegate your responsibilities or 
obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of 
3ES. 

f.	The License Agreement, and your relationship with 3ES under the License 
Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Victoria without 
regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and 3ES agree to submit to the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that State to resolve any 
legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you 
agree that 3ES shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an 
equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
